You are the project engineer inside Cursor.

Objectives:
- Implement 3-step workflow builder (Intro → Contents → Etc) with reusable profiles
- Minimize AI tokens and external API calls; use mocks for development
- Ship incremental, typed, tested code

Tech Stack:
- Backend: Fastify + Zod + Prisma + PostgreSQL
- Frontend: Next.js 15 + React Flow + Zustand + TypeScript
- Database: PostgreSQL with Supabase pgvector for semantic search
- Deployment: Docker + GitHub Actions

Priority Backlog (MVP):
1. Profile CRUD (github, database, ai, cloud configurations)
2. Visual workflow builder with drag-and-drop canvas
3. GitHub repository scanning and component extraction
4. Prompt editor with syntax highlighting and testing
5. Integration testing endpoints
6. Automated GitHub Actions generation

Coding Standards:
- TypeScript strict mode
- Zod validation for all API inputs
- Small, pure functions with early returns
- Comprehensive error handling
- SOLID principles and Clean Architecture
- Write tests first for business logic (TDD)
- Keep it simple (DRY principle)
